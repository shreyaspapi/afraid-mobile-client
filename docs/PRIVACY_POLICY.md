# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025

## Introduction

Parity ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Parity handles information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

Parity does not collect, transmit, store, or share any of the following:
- Personal identification information
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Device information
- Location data
- Advertising identifiers
- Any data transmitted to third parties

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following information is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to us:

1. **Server Credentials**
   - Unraid server IP addresses or hostnames
   - API keys for server authentication
   - Server names and configurations

2. **Cached Server Data**
   - System metrics (CPU, RAM, disk usage)
   - Docker container information
   - Virtual machine information
   - Notification history

3. **App Settings**
   - Display preferences (theme, refresh intervals)
   - Notification preferences
   - Multi-server configurations

All locally stored data is encrypted using your device's secure storage mechanisms (iOS Keychain or Android Keystore).

## How Your Data is Used

### Local Storage Only

All data stored by Parity remains on your device. We use this data solely to:
- Authenticate with your Unraid server(s)
- Display server information in the app
- Provide offline access to recently viewed data
- Remember your preferences and settings

### Network Communication

Parity communicates directly with your Unraid server(s) using the credentials you provide. This communication:
- Occurs only between your device and your specified server(s)
- Uses standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Does not involve any intermediary services
- Is not monitored, logged, or analyzed by us

We do not have access to your server credentials or any data exchanged between the app and your servers.

## Data Sharing

Parity does not share any data with third parties. There are no:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services (unless you explicitly opt in)
- Cloud backup services
- Social media integrations

## Third-Party Services

Parity does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.

If you choose to enable optional features in the future (such as cloud backup or crash reporting), you will be explicitly asked for permission, and those services will have their own privacy policies.

## Data Retention

### Local Data

Data stored on your device remains until you:
- Clear app data through the app settings
- Uninstall the application
- Manually delete individual server configurations

### No Remote Data

Since we do not collect or store any data on our servers, there is no remote data retention.

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:

1. **Access:** All data is accessible through the app's interface
2. **Modification:** You can edit server configurations at any time
3. **Deletion:** You can delete server configurations or all app data
4. **Export:** Server configurations can be manually recorded for backup

### How to Delete Your Data

To delete all data stored by Parity:

**iOS:**
1. Go to iPhone Settings > Parity
2. Tap "Delete All Data" (if available)
3. Or uninstall the app to remove all data

**Android:**
1. Go to Settings > Apps > Parity
2. Tap "Storage" > "Clear Data"
3. Or uninstall the app to remove all data

## Children's Privacy

Parity does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is designed for server administrators and requires technical knowledge to use. We recommend that children under 13 do not use this app without parental supervision.

## Security

We take security seriously:

1. **Encryption:** All credentials are encrypted using platform-standard secure storage
2. **Biometric Protection:** Optional Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint authentication
3. **Local Storage:** All sensitive data remains on your device
4. **No Transmission:** We never receive or transmit your credentials
5. **Open Source:** Our code is publicly available for security review

### Your Responsibilities

To maintain security:
- Keep your device password/PIN secure
- Use strong API keys on your Unraid server
- Enable biometric authentication in the app
- Keep your device's operating system updated
- Don't share your device with untrusted users

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be:
- Posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date
- Announced in app release notes
- Available on our GitHub repository

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
